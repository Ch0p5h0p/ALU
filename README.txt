I'm new to Logisim Evolution, so all of the 8 bit parts, instead of being done with 8 bit pin, are done with consecutive 8 bit parts. I realized you could do 8 bit pins later, so some things are made with 8 bit pins. I don't really have plans to fix it either, because this was a project to show my understanding of an ALU and registers, not a project to show my understanding of Logisim Evolution.
